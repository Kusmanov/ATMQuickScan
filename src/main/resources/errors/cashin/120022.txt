ERROR:
Safety switch is active.

EXPLANATION/ACTION:
– Check whether the CCDM (head module and cassette module) is pushed into the device correctly (locking mechanism!) and whether the safety switch is correctly bridged.
– Check the connection cable between the safety switch and the back panel.
– Restart the CCDM.
– If the error reoccurs, replace the safety switch.

After the LINE XSA module has been reconfigured, there is a waiting period of up to 270 seconds until the CCDM is ready for operation.
