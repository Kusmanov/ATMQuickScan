ERROR:
Banknote jam during dispensing.

EXPLANATION/ACTION:
A note jam has been discovered in the dispensing areas or in the vertical transports of the dispensing units or in the stacker during the dispensing transaction (photosensors PSDx, DDU, PS1, PS18). Check the banknote path from the cassettes up to the stacking compartment or the reject compartment for jammed notes. Check for correct seating of the plug connections on the CMD controller and/or on the elements of the photosensors. Afterwards, bring the CMD-V4 or the VCMD back into the safe into dispensing position, whereby the safety switch is closed and the CMD-V4 or VCMD is started up again (Reset). If the status display continues to show '18' after this start-up, then the jam was not effectively eliminated and/or another jam has occurred. Use the test program self-test command to check the 'Status of the photosensors'. If a photosensor (besides the 'cassette empty photosensor') is reported as being 'covered', determine the reason and eliminate the error. If no error can be determined and if '18' continues to be displayed after the next start-up, then the stacker, the respective dispensing unit or the controller must be replaced.
